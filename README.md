My name is underdog, I'm from China 🇨🇳 but currently wondering around between 🇫🇷 and 🇫🇮. 

I am a student 👨🏻‍🏫 in the morning, a researcher 👨‍🎓 in the daytime, and a open-source lover 🧑🏾‍💻 at night.

When I'm not working, I love running 🏃, basketball 🏀, football ⚽️, and heavy lifting 🏋️.

- 🔭 I’m currently trying to survive and obtain a PhD degree on speech processing. My main research interests are speaker verification and speech recognition.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in Rust and Golang. Also trying to recap C++ by seeking some mini projects.
- 👯 I'm a team player in general. Research wise I'd like to be a bit independent though.
- 🤔 I’m always looking for help with programming and better enginnering practice from everyone around.
- 📫 How to reach me: I have a [semi-academic website](https://underdogliu.github.io) with all details you wanna know. One of my goals for 2021 is to write more posts there (not easy to achieve though).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact 1: I don't like intentional traveling at all but somehow I'm forced to be a nomad. Since the first time I went abroad, I've been living (not short-term traveling) at 6 different cities in 5 years.
- ⚡ Fun fact 2: I'm a minimalist (as a result of being a nomad).
