My name is underdogliu, I'm a speech processing researcher from China🇨🇳. Currently living around between 🇫🇷 and 🇫🇮. 

I am a student 👨🏻‍🏫 in the morning, a researcher 👨‍🎓 in the daytime, and a open-source lover 🧑🏾‍💻 at night.

When I'm not working, I love running 🏃, basketball 🏀, and heavy lifting.

- 🔭 I’m currently trying to survive from a PhD degree on speech processing, main research interests are speaker verification and speech recognition (was for this one, now much less).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in Rust and Julia. Also trying to recap C++ by some mini projects.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with programming and better enginnering practice, in general.
- 📫 How to reach me: I have a [semi-academic website](https://underdogliu.github.io) with all details you wanna know. One of my goals for 2021 is to write more posts there (not easy to achieve though).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact 1: I don't like intentional traveling at all but somehow I'm forced to be a nomad. Since the first time I went abroad, I've been living (not short-term traveling) at 6 different cities in 5 years.
- ⚡ Fun fact 2: I'm a minimalist.
